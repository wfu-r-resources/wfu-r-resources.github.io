## Literacy and GDP data

Run the following R code to import data on literacy and GDP for each country:

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
library(tidyverse)
library(googlesheets4)
gs4_deauth()
gdp_data <- read_sheet("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RctTQmKB0hzbm1E8rGcufYdMshRdhmYdeL29nXqmvsc/pub?gid=0")
lit_data = read_sheet("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hDinTIRHQIaZg1RUn6Z_6mo12PtKwEPFIz_mJVF6P5I/pub?gid=0")
```

As in the previous activity, we can reshape the datasets:

```{r}
gdp_data <- gdp_data |>
  rename(country = starts_with("Income")) |>
  pivot_longer(-country, names_to = "year", values_to = "gdp",
               values_drop_na = TRUE)

lit_data <- lit_data |>
  rename(country = starts_with("Adult")) |>
  pivot_longer(-country, names_to = "year", values_to = "literacy",
               values_drop_na = TRUE)
```

:::{.question}
#### Question 1
Use a join to create a dataset containing both the literacy rate and gdp for countries in each year. Keep only the rows with information on both gdp and literacy rate:

```{r, echo=F}
lit_data |>
  inner_join(gdp_data, join_by(country, year)) |>
  head()
```

## Air quality

In the next question, we will work with air quality data. There are two tables: the `air_quality` table contains information on different air quality measurements for multiple locations, while the `air_parameters` table contains information on the different air quality measurements.

The datasets can be loaded into R as follows:

```{r}
air_quality <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pandas-dev/pandas/main/doc/data/air_quality_long.csv")
air_parameters <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pandas-dev/pandas/main/doc/data/air_quality_parameters.csv")
```


:::{.question}
#### Question 2
Use a left join to add information about each air quality measurement to the `air_quality` table.

## NYC Flights

In the next questions, we will return to data on NYC flights in 2013 from the `nycflights13` package. We will use two tables from the package: the `flights` table, which contains information on each flight, and the `planes` table, which contains information on each plane (uniquely identified by `tailnum`).

:::{.question}
#### Question 3
In R, use a left join to add information about each plane to the `flights` table.
:::

Looking at the results from question 3, you will see that there are *two* year columns in the output of the join. This is because `year` is a column in both `flights` and `planes`. However, we don't want to join on year, because it represents different information (year of the flight, vs. year of manufacture). 

Since we don't join on `year`, and R won't allow multiple columns with the same name in one data frame, then the output has two year columns: `year.x` (from `flights`), and `year.y` (from `planes`). The `year.y` column contains information on date of manufacture.

:::{.question}
#### Question 4
What is the oldest plane (identified by `tailnum`) which flew from NYC airports in 2013?
