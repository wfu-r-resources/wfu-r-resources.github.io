# Data wrangling with gapminder data

In this activity, we will work with data on global health and economic development. The data is called `gapminder`, and is part of the `gapminder` package in R. You will need to install the `gapminder` package before beginning the activity.

:::{.question}
#### Question 1
Create a new data frame, containing only countries in 2007 with life expectancy at least 70 years and GDP per capita at most $20000.
:::

:::{.question}
#### Question 2
Count the number of countries in each continent in the data for 2007.
:::


:::{.question}
#### Question 3
Calculate the median natural log of GDP per capita in countries with a life expectancy of at least 70 years in 2007.
:::

:::{.question}
#### Question 4
Calculate the median natural log of GDP per capita in countries with a life expectancy of at least 70 years in 2007, broken down by continent.
:::

:::{.question}
#### Question 5
Does it matter whether we `mutate` or `filter` first in question 4?
:::

:::{.question}
#### Question 6
Calculate the median life expectancy for each continent in 2007, and the correlation between log GDP per capita and life expectancy for each continent in 2007.
:::

:::{.question}
#### Question 7
Using your summary statistics, describe the relationship between log GDP per capita and life expectancy, and summarize the differences between continents.

# Data wrangling with health violations

The `Violations` data from the `mdsr` package contains information on 480621 health inspections conducted on restaurants in New York City. 

:::{.question}
#### Question 8

Use the `Violations` data to create a new data frame called `violations_summary`, which contains the median inspection score by zip code for zip codes in Manhattan with 50 or more inspections.

*Hint*: You will probably want to remove rows with missing observations for zip code, borough, or inspection score. The `drop_na` function can be useful here. Below is some starter code, you will need to complete the rest:

```{r, eval=F}
violations_summary <- Violations |>
  drop_na(zipcode, score, boro) |>
  ...
```

:::


:::{.question}
#### Question 9

Plot the number of median score vs. the number of inspections, using the `violations_summary` data you created in the previous question.
