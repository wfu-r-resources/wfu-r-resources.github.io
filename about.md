# R and Computing Resources

Welcome to the WFU Department of Statistical Sciences! The purpose of this site is to provide activities to help you prepare for the computing you will need in our MS in Statistics program. Depending on your level, you may be familiar with all of the material contained in the activities, or some of it may be new to you. In case some material is new, we have provided links to some relevant (free!) online textbooks that are great resources for foundational statistical computing.

A note about the packages used: several `tidyverse` packages are widely used in the activities here, particularly for data wrangling and visualization. However, there are almost alternatives and multiple ways to do something in R (it just isn't possible to provide all possible approaches in any given activity). If you are more comfortable with base R, that is ok! 

## What's on this site

We have compiled a set of [Modules](https://wfu-r-resources.github.io/calendar/) containing activities on data wrangling and visualization, basic linear regression, and functions and iteration. More activities will be added in the future! For each module there is a set of several activities, which give you several opportunities to practice the skills covered in that module. Some modules are marked as "Bonus" modules, which means the content is valuable but probably won't be needed for your courses, at least not in the first year.

## Other resources

If you are looking for other tutorials and resources beyond the activities on this site, here are several that we recommend. We have also included some recommended readings from some of the textbooks on the activity page.

**Online tutorials and activities:**

  * [Our Coding Club](https://ourcodingclub.github.io/tutorials.html) (has a wide range of topics, particularly wrangling, visualization, and modeling in R)
  * [Kaggle learn](https://www.kaggle.com/learn) (particularly good for Python, SQL, and statistical learning topics)

**Recommended books:**

  * [Modern Data Science with R (3rd edition)](https://mdsr-book.github.io/mdsr3e/)
  * [Advanced R (2nd edition)](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/index.html)
  * [R for Data Science (1st edition)](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)
  * [R for Data Science (2nd edition)](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/)
  * [Python for Data Analysis (3rd edition)](https://wesmckinney.com/book/)
